# Project Generation Script for Mbed CE!
This is a simple script that generates Mbed CE projects from scratch. The procedure is the same as in the [documentation](https://mbed-ce.dev/getting-started/creating-a-project/#creating-a-new-project-from-scratch).

## Requirements
You are required to have installed all necessary toolchains in order to run this script. You are also required to have a stable network connection.

Haven't done that yet? No worries, just check [this](https://mbed-ce.dev/getting-started/toolchain-install/) page in the docs!

## Usage

```bash
# Assuming you have downloaded the script and have it in the same folder as this terminal is opened in:

# If necessary, change permissions so the script can be executed:
chmod +x mbed_generate_project.sh

# Run the script:
./mbed_generate_project.sh
```
